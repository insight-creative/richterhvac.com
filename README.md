# Richter Heating & Cooling

A custom Hugo website built from the Insight Creative, Inc. Hugo starter boilerplate Quintessence. The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) boilerplate we use for our projects.

The repo for the boilerplate can be found at https://github.com/insight-creative/Quintessence

**Disclaimer** - This site has been heavily integrated with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and therefore many features are specific to the Netlify platform and may not work with other hosting providers.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository, then run the following from the project root:

```
npm install
hugo server
```

Simple as that, you can now start building everything you need. Hugo's server has automatic, powerful, and insanely fast SCSS, JS, and image processing through their Hugo Pipes system. Read more about that in the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/).
