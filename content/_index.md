testimonials:
  - testimonial: In considering the regulations for the commercial addition to our business, Richter Heating and Air Conditioning did “WHATEVER IT TAKES!” to complete our project. Adam, Bill and Rosy tackled the unusual specifics and time deadlines, often going above and beyond to successfully finish our project on time. All our questions and requests were handled promptly, personally and professionally. We truly were recipients of “Whatever it takes” and appreciate the awesome job they did for us.

    company: "Sugar Island Barn, Watertown, WI"
  - testimonial: Called Richter on Wednesday for a quote on a new furnace and by Monday morning it was installed during the coldest week of the year! Got quotes from other heating places in Watertown and Richter was the most affordable as well. From quote to the techs installing it, everyone did a fantastic job. Would highly recommend them!

  - testimonial: Being in Real Estate, I work with a lot of great contractors and rarely do I write reviews like I should. Richter Heating deserves a review more than anyone though! This company is amazing! I have been using them for years and refer them to all my clients. If you want great prices, great communication and FAST service there is NO ONE in this area that beats them. Thank you for everything you have done for my clients and my family!
